I am a Ph.D. candidate conducting research on biogeochemical processes in abandoned mine drainage at Duquesne University and NETL-DOE under an ORISE research fellowship. My current projects characterize AMD feedstocks using field and computational methods while also exploring microbiological avenues for critical mineral extraction and recovery. 

I have taken academic, professional, seasonal, and freelance opportunities to widen my research breadth and find my niche. I have a decade of research experience spanning biological, chemical, ecological, and computational sciences. These opportunities have helped me flesh out my preference for multi-disciplinary approaches to scientific questions.
