I am a Ph.D. candidate conducting research on biogeochemical processes in abandoned mine drainage at Duquesne University and NETL-DOE under an ORISE research fellowship. My current projects characterize AMD feedstocks using field and computational methods while also exploring microbiological avenues for critical mineral extraction and recovery. 

I have taken academic, professional, seasonal, and freelance opportunities to widen my research breadth and find my niche. I have a decade of research experience spanning biological, chemical, ecological, and computational sciences. These opportunities have helped me flesh out my preference for multi-disciplinary approaches to scientific questions.

I anticipate searching for positions with late 2026 or early 2027 start dates. Currently I am open to work in academic, government, or industry positions with a preference for multi-disciplinary laboratories that permit hybrid work. Ultimately, I would like to work towards becoming a principal investigator in any of these settings.
