My current projects characterize AMD feedstocks using field and computational methods while also exploring microbiological avenues for critical mineral extraction and recovery.</p> <p>I have taken academic, professional, seasonal, and freelance opportunities to widen my research breadth and find my niche. I have a decade of research experience spanning biological, chemical, ecological, and computational sciences. These opportunities have helped me flesh out my preference for multi-disciplinary approaches to scientific questions.</p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too.
